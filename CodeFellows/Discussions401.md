What are the primitive data types?
byte
short
int

Explain to a non-technical friend the difference in how compilation works in Java and JavaScript.
Javascript does not get compiled it is an interpreted language where browsers compile it in real time. The proper term is JIT and all that does it turns the javascript code in to bytecode as it is about to run. Java on the other hand is statically typed and the actual types and access for the code are determined at compilation once compiled the java virtual machine will be able to run the code other than that there is no JIT with Java. 

Does code compiling mean that it works correctly?
Not always working correctly can be interpreted many ways code compiling only means that the code is free of syntax errors but it may not behave as expected or the logic behind the code may not be calculating something correctly. Even worse if a connection is to be established compiled code may not be an indicator that this is actually occurring
