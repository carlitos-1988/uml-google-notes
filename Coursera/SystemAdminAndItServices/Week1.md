# Week 1

## Introduction to System Administration and IT Infrastructure Services

### Course Introduction

- System administration, the field in IT that's responsible for maintaining reliable computer systems in a multi-user environment

### What is System Administration

- IT infrastructure encompasses the software, the hardware, network, and services required for an organization to operate in an enterprise IT environment
- automation of workflows is key to becoming a good system administrator

### Servers Revisited

- Sys Admins will work on the following:

  - Email
  - File Storage
  - Running a website

- These types of services will always exist in servers
- Server, software or machine that provides services to other software machines
- a server can respond to many clients at once and a client can receive from many servers at once
- KVM Switch (Keyboard Video Mouse)
  - The KVM switch will allow you to control multiple servers from one workstation

### The Cloud

- Data Center, a facility that stores hundreds, if not thousands of servers
- cost implications when storing your own data and costs for using the 'cloud' each has positives and negatives

## System Administration Tasks

### Organizational Policies

- in smaller organizations IT policies may come from the sysAdmin while in larger companies the CTO would be responsible for implementing these policies
- common policy questions:
  - Should users be allowed to install software?
  - Should users have complex passwords with certain requirements?
  - Should users be allowed to view non-work-related websites, like Facebook?
  - if you hand out a company phone to an employee, should you set a device password?

### IT Infrastructure Services

- Other infrastructure services:
  - Network services
  - Secure connection to websites
  - updating as necessary

### User and Hardware Provisioning

- another responsibility sysAdmins have is managing users and hardware
- They have to be able to create new users and give them access to company resources
- They also have to remove users from having access to company resources, they are also responsible for user machines
- also have to ensure that the machines are standardized in some way not only the computer settings but also the hardware lifecycle of the machine
- 4 main stages of hardware lifecycle:
  - Procurement
  - Deployment
  - Maintenance
  - Retirement

### Routine Maintenance

- batch updates, take time to shutdown the server make sure the update is installed and lastly check for anything bad that could happen to it.

### Vendors

- working with vendors is a common practice for sysAdmins
  Vendor Life-Cycle for Custom Services and Products
  Vendor Life-Cycle for Custom Services and Products
  Another important vendor life-cycle involves the engagement and management of service vendors. IT Support professionals may need to engage and/or manage service vendor relationships as part of their job responsibilities. Service vendors are often businesses that offer specialized services, products, and/or skilled labor to other businesses. Many organizations outsource business needs to these types of vendors as cost saving measures to temporarily augment staff, and to more efficiently manage company time and resources.

Hiring temporary contractors on an as-needed basis can be a disruptive, lengthy, and expensive process. Employing a full-service vendor, on the other hand, simplifies the process to a single contract agreement, allowing the vendor to assume responsibility for supplying and managing the resources necessary to carry out your project. For example, your organization may choose to outsource a company-wide computer system upgrade to a vendor that can supply a temporary IT workforce to implement the large-scale project. Using a vendor for this project may save your organization the time, expense, effort, and liability associated with hiring, training, and managing individual contractors.

Vendor life-cycle management for custom services and products
Vendor life-cycle management is an end-to-end standardization for conducting business partnerships with vendors. As a best practice for business management, organizations should develop standard policies and procedures for the procurement and management of vendors.

The standard vendor lifecycle can be categorized into three contract phases and eight management steps:

Phase one - Pre-contract
Phase one of the vendor lifecycle management process begins with an organization identifying the need to outsource a process or project to a services vendor.

Vendor identification and engagement: An organization identifies potential vendors and engages them to collect more information about the vendor’s business offerings and capabilities. The organization will inform the vendors of the service needs and will solicit “requests for proposals” (RFPs), “invitations to bid” (ITB), or other similar proposal documents from the vendor. The organization will select a small number of promising proposals to analyze in greater depth. Some organizations may have official procurement officers to ensure fair and ethical vendor selections.

Vendor qualification and risk mitigation: The organization advances the shortlisted proposals to the qualification stage. In this stage, the organization and/or procurement officers request additional information from the vendor to help exclude vendors that might pose a risk to the organization.

Vendor evaluation and selection: The organization and/or procurement officers evaluate the vendor information collected during the qualification phase. The organization’s vendor selection team analyzes the vendor information to determine each vendor’s health and stability as a business, as well as their ability to deliver on the organization's request. Some of the data points used in this evaluation and selection may include the vendor’s:

History: Does the vendor have a clean business record?

Ratings and quality: What are other customers saying about the vendor online and through services like the Better Business Bureau?

Expertise: Does the vendor have the experience, skills, talent, and/or expertise to deliver on needed services?

Cost: Will the vendor’s proposal fit into the organization’s budget?

Offer compliance: Does the vendor’s proposal fulfill all of the requirements of the organization’s request?

Responsiveness and customer service: How long does it take the vendor to respond to the organization’s requests? What is the vendor’s approach to offering timely customer service?

Once a vendor is selected, the organization will negotiate a statement of work (SoW) and contract terms with the vendor. Performance criteria, milestones, and deliverables should be well-defined in the SoW and contract.

Vendor information management and onboarding: The selected vendor goes through an onboarding process with the organization. Information about the vendor is recorded in the organization’s procurement system and provided to the appropriate stakeholders for the engagement. Information management is important to the vendor life-cycle management and maintaining strategic relationships with vendors. The organization's IT department may issue IT equipment to the vendor for establishing secure and monitored connections to the organization’s network. The organization might also offer vendors training sessions for the organization’s relevant policies, procedures, expectations, systems, network, tools, etc.

Phase two - Contract delivery
Performance management monitoring: Organizations often assign a project manager to monitor the performance criteria, milestones, due dates, and deliverables defined in the SoW and contract. It is vital to vendor and project management to ensure the vendor is meeting the contracted expectations on time and on budget. The organization should conduct regular performance reviews and may request improvements to the vendor’s performance. How the vendor responds to improvement requests is important to the business relationship and can positively or negatively affect opportunities for future engagements.

Risk management: Organizations and project managers should also monitor and analyze potential risks during the course of the vendor engagement.

Supply chain risk management: If the vendor’s product or service depends on a supply chain, contingency plans need to be in place to prevent negative impacts to the project if a disruption to the supply chain occurs. Additionally, it is important to ensure the vendor does not create compliance problems with supply chains, as this risk might impact the organization’s reputation.

Product upgrade limitations and other risks: Organizations must monitor risks related to updating, maintaining, and upgrading the vendor’s deliverables. Especially important is the availability and capability of the vendor to provide these periodic updates or upgrades. Contingent plans should be defined in case the vendor cannot meet this need.

Vendor relationship management: Organizations can support their relationships with vendors by:

Developing a communication plan with frequent check-ins

Building and maintaining healthy partnerships

Ensuring all parties benefit from the engagement

Phase three - Post-contract
Vendor offboarding: When the vendor project comes to an end, the post-contract closing process is initiated. The organization’s project manager and/or a procurement officer are often assigned to facilitate the vendor offboarding. In this phase, the organization performs an analysis to ensure the vendor has met all contractual obligations. Any residual obligations, like warranties and post contract support are revisited, and sometimes revised, with the vendor and relevant stakeholders of the organization.

Warranties: The organization should keep detailed records of any vendor or third-party warranties provided for the deliverables from the vendor engagement. All stakeholders should be made aware of the inclusions, exclusions, and expiration dates of the warranties.

Post-contract support: The organization should keep detailed records of any services, like technical support, supplied in the post-contract phase. The organization’s contract with the vendor should have a clearly defined maintenance clause or a statement that post-contract support is not included.

Finally, the organization’s project manager and/or a procurement officer uses the organization’s offboarding checklist to complete the post-contract closing. The checklist might include requesting the vendor return IT equipment and removing the vendor identity profiles on the organization’s network. IT Support professionals might also be enlisted to ensure any intellectual property belonging to the organization is stored properly with necessary security precautions.

### Troubleshooting and Managing Issues

### In case of fire, break glass

- it is important that company data is backed up somewhere on a routine basis

## Applying Changes

### With great power comes great responsibility

- Avoid using administrator rights for tasks that don't require them
- example don't browse the web as an administrator
- respect the privacy of others dont access information you have no business accessing
- Think before you type, the actions you take have far more consequences than you think you have
- `scrit` in linux used to `Start-Transcript` and in windows to record what is used in the command line to be used and seen later
- With great power comes great responsibility
- Reverting to the previous state is called a rollback
- some commands are easier to rall back than others, deleting can be much more difficult to roll back

Change Management
IT change management is a standardized process for planning, communicating, and implementing technical changes to information systems. IT Support professionals are often responsible for installations, updates, upgrades, migrations, etc. to an organization’s software, hardware, network security policy, data storage policy, cloud platforms, and more. IT Support staff are expected to make these changes while also minimizing disruptions to the organization’s IT services. By following IT change management best practices, IT Support professionals can create robust plans for change rollouts that protect business continuity. The change management plan is often reviewed by change board approvals, management teams, and/or project stakeholders for risk assessment, feedback, and plan approvals or rejections.

IT change management plans
Each organization will have their own change management policies, processes, and procedures. However, there are several common items that should be included in change management plans as a best practice. When proposing a change, IT professionals may create documentation or use change request forms to detail the following elements:

Person/team responsible for the change: Names at least one person as the responsible party for overseeing the change management plan.

Change priority: States the urgency of the change. For example, critical security patches would have a high priority and need to be scheduled ASAP. Whereas, a software update that merely adds new features might be a very low priority and can be scheduled for a convenient future date.

Change description: Gives an overview of the planned changes. The change description should also provide a list of the planned changes. For example, if the change involves updating firmware on several router models, the description should include which routers and models will be updated. Additionally, the plan should list the old firmware versions currently on the routers along with the new firmware versions to be applied during the update.

Purpose of the change: Explains why the change is necessary. For IT Support professionals, the most common reasons for changes are operating system, software, driver, and firmware patches and updates, as well as hardware and peripheral upgrades. Installations, implementations, and redesigns of software and hardware systems are also common IT changes. IT Support professionals should regularly evaluate the need for improvements and changes to network security policies and procedures. Laws, regulations, and company policies may also require changes to how organizations store, transmit, and protect data.

Scope of the change: Describes the extent of the changes. The documentation should include a list of all IT systems (hardware, software, etc.), locations, departments, individuals, vendors, partners, customers, and others the changes affect, whether directly or indirectly. Any changes to policies, processes, or procedures should also be recorded.

Date, time, and duration of the change: Indicates when the change is scheduled to take place and the duration of the change rollout. If the change is expected to create service outages, the person or team responsible for managing the change should inform all affected staff about the outage before the systems are taken offline. IT changes are often implemented outside of normal business hours, when systems can be taken offline with minimal disruption. For organizations with traditional Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. business hours, changes are usually planned to begin in the early evening on a Friday, after end users have logged out for the weekend. The change implementation process should include plenty of contingency time before the next business day in order to test, troubleshoot, repair, and roll-back any changes that are not successful. When an unsuccessful change occurs, IT Support professionals may need to work through the night and into the next morning. Organizations and IT departments may opt to hire a vendor to perform overnight system changes to adhere to company overtime policies and labor laws.

Change rollback or backout plan: In case of primary plan failures, details a rollback plan to return the affected systems back to their original state before the changes were attempted. Additionally, a secondary or alternative plan may be included. This could be a plan to activate a failover system to replace any problemed systems until they are repaired. IT Support professionals should detail the steps involved in the rollback and/or alternative plans, including the original configuration settings and software, patch, driver, and/or firmware versions. Files needed to rollback updates and patches should be downloaded and stored in an accessible location to simplify rollbacks. Cloud-based virtual systems can be restored in seconds by simply using clones of saved previous VM states.

Technical evaluation: Records the results of any testing performed on the proposed changes in a lab or sandboxed environment. The testing environment should be as similar to the target environment as possible. For example, the same operating system versions, hardware parts, drivers, firmware, etc. of the target system should be reflected in the lab/sandbox testing environment. Setting up a testing sandbox for cloud platforms should be as simple as cloning the virtual system(s) targeted for updates. The plans should also include metrics for evaluating if a change is successful or not.

Systems affected by the change: Lists all IT resources (including hardware, software, networked, and cloud systems) that will experience direct or indirect changes as a result of the change rollout.

Anticipated impact of changes: Describes how the planned changes are expected to impact the affected systems. For example, if the change involves adding new servers to a resource pool, the plan might describe that this increase in load capacity will result in system performance improvements and faster server response times.

Resources needed to implement the change: Lists the human resources, budget, time, management oversight, subject matter expert (SME) consultations, training, equipment, hardware, software, parts, systems, tools, insurance policies, and any other resource needed to complete the planned changes.

Training for users impacted by the change: Outlines any training needs to help users adapt to the changes. This might include classes on how to use new software applications, hands-on practice with new hardware, a company-wide announcement for security procedure changes, and more.

Risk level for change: Describes how much risk is involved in making the proposed changes. Some changes are high risk and might cause catastrophic failures if the plan goes wrong. For example, an upgrade involving a single point of failure on a critical system could create a system-wide outage. In this case, it would be wise to implement a redundant failover system for that critical system before attempting any other changes.

Change instructions: Details each step of the planned changes. This should be formatted as an instruction manual for the IT Support professionals to follow to ensure there is no guesswork involved in implementing the changes.

Change board approvals
Some large organizations may have a Change Advisory Board (CAB). The CAB is a board of directors appointed to oversee all implemented IT changes in the organization. The CAB can be the official governing body to approve or deny change management plans. They may advise on needed adjustments to the plan to meet business goals or to comply with regulatory compliance criteria. The CAB may also assist with mitigating risk brought about by proposed changes.

User acceptance
Including a user acceptance process for information system changes is a best practice in IT change management. IT change management plans can include a beta testing period similar to software development user acceptance testing. This plan might include several days of testing by a select group of users to ensure that the changes have been successful and that there are no hidden surprises caused by the changes. The change management team for the plan should develop user acceptance criteria forms for the beta testers to complete. The criteria normally includes common activities that all end users should be able to perform successfully in the new or changed environment. A period of time should be reserved for fixing any problems the beta testers find. When beta testing is successful and the changes have been accepted/approved by the users, the changes should become available to all appropriate end users.

### Recording your actions

When you are going to make changes in a machine, it’s very important to have a clear plan of what you are going to do and to store the actions that you actually took.

A common practice for system administrators that work with bug queues or ticketing systems is to include the commands executed and the output obtained in the corresponding bug or ticket. This is recommended if the commands that need to be executed are few and straightforward.

However, there are situations where you don’t yet know which commands exactly you’ll need to execute because there’s some investigation that needs to happen. In cases like that, it can be helpful to use a command like
script for Linux <https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lunar/en/man1/script.1.html> or Start-Transcript for Windows <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.host/start-transcript?view=powershell-7.3&viewFallbackFrom=powershell-6>.

`script`

In the case of script, you can call it like this:

          script session.log

This will write the contents of your session to the session.log file. When you want to stop recording, you can write exit or press Ctrl-D. The generated file will be in ANSI format which includes the colors that were displayed on screen. In order to read them, you can use commands like ansi2txt or ansi2html to convert it to plain text or HTML respectively.

`Start-Transcript`

In the case of Start-Transcript, you can call it like this:

            Start-Transcript -Path C:\Transcript.txt

This will write the contents of the session to C:\Transcript.txt. When you want to stop recording you need to call Stop-Transcript. The file created is a plain text file where the commands executed and their outputs are stored.

### Never Test in Production

- Production the part of the infrastructure where a certain service is executed and served to its users
- Test environment a virtual machine running the same configuration as the production environment, but isin't actually serving any users of service
- Secondary or Stand-by-Machine, this machine will be exactly the same as a production machine, but won't receive any traffic from actual users until you enable it to do so
- first apply changes tot he secondary machine
- Once the changes have been applied, make the sand-by machine the primary machine, and then apply the changes to the other machine.
- no matter how minor the change may seem like it is always good practive to be able to test changes in a test environment before doing anything to production

### Assessing Risk

- it is portant to:
  - test changes before they are made
  - document what you do
  - have a way to revert to a previous state
- not all services are critical to the continuation of a business and it is important to identify who is impacted if a service where to go down and what sort of impact this will have on the business
- In general, the more users your service reaches the more you'll want to ensure that changes aren't disruptive

### Fixing things the right way

- before start fixing an error make sure you can recreate the error
- Reproduction case, creating a roadmap to retrace the steps that led the user to an unexpected outcome
- When recreating the error :
  - What steps did you take to get to this point?
  - what's the unexpected(bad) result?
  - what's the expected result?
- Remember: always do this in your test instance never in production
- After applying your fix, retrace the same steps that took you to the bad experience
- If your fix worked, the experience should now take place
-
